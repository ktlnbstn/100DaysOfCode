# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### GOALS
I so easily get caught up in wanting to research 'what I should be learning,' that my personal projects have suffered. With this 100 Day challenge, I will dedicate a short amount of time each day to just create, no shame otherwise attached. I have two goals:
 #### 1) Bolster my personal project with a new front-end.

### Day 0: July 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Two goals with lots of TODOs. Working on Week 1 of Course 1 out of 4 in the OOP in Java: Data Structures and Algorithm Specialization.

**Thoughts**: Reprioritized my goals. Reaffirming my direction.

-------------------
### Day 1: July 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Cleaning up minor PuppyLove errors and features so I can prep it for hosting asap!

**Thoughts:** Coding a project is sooo much more fun than studying algorithms.

-------------------
### Day 2: July 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working on user input error validation. Testing, testing, testing...

-------------------
### Day 3: July 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working on validating the input during the 'Edit Playdate' event. 

**Thoughts**: Coding is having the knowledge to know how to put working code together, combined with the patience to debug 
that code.

-------------------
### Day 4: July 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Validation work complete! GoogleMaps functionality added! 

**Thoughts**: Coding(debugging) gets so much easier with practice. I solved so many problems, very easily, on my own today. Felt great.

-------------------
### Day 5: July 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: PuppyLove is hosted! Register now! 

**Thoughts**: One moment I was lost in Jenkins CI, and the next I had a hosted web application that I shared with my friends and the world. Really brought home the idea that when you're lost/confused/sad from coding, just step away from your desk. Feels pretty good.

-------------------
### Day 6: July 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: PuppyLove is hosted, now working on updating. I hope I found a way to make the upstart time faster, Uptime Robot will ping the site every 8 minutes. Ideally Heroku servers keep PL alive so visitors have an easy time visiting it. I also went to a Cracking the Coding Interview Meetup to keep up my DS/A practice.

-------------------
### Day 7: July 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Back to learning now that the project is live. Made a custom Map that displayed two maps able to zoom in with your mouse. Played with PApplet, Microsoft Maps, and design modifications.

-------------------
### Day 8: July 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Last two days have been a combo a apprenticeship applications. So less focus on coding sadly. But today I sat down for an hour of DS in Java. Helpful to keep thinking about code everyday even if it's not your main focus.

-------------------
### Day 9: July 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More focus on DS. Phone interviews upcoming!

-------------------
### Day 10: August 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working with Processing and Unfolding Maps library to generate a map of earthquakes, categorized by size.

-------------------
### Day 11: August 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fisnished the map of earthquakes, categorized by size.

-------------------
### Day 12: August 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working with to generate a more nuanced map of earthquakes, categorized by size, depth, and location.

-------------------
### Day 13: August 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working on creating a basic React app for a prospective employer. I wanted to learn React, here's my quickstart version!

-------------------
### Day 14: August 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Event-Driven programming! Half way through, implemented hover for additional info. Click to clear other markers away is upcoming. GUI work is not my favorite.

-------------------
### Day 15: August 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the Event-Driven project. Now if a certain earthquake or city is clicked on, other markers are hidden. When clicking on a city, when an earthquakes is nearby, it will still be displayed (as seen in pic below).

-------------------
### Day 16: August 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the OOP course. Next is Data Structures like I originally planned for. This last week was about implementing sorting and searching so the data displayed nicely. I added airports to my earthquake data so we could see the relationship between those two data points. You can also see the airport routes displayed and the airport name and locaiton displayed when hovering over the point.

-------------------
### Day 17: August 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Creating a Hangman app for an interview. Very cool concept for newbs and strong coders alike. Lots of room to meet the basic specs or take them higher. No details, images, or links to work (yet) ovbiously.

-------------------
### Day 18: August 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: SAME AS THE 25TH.

-------------------
### Day 19: August 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: SAME AS THE 27TH.

-------------------
### Day 20: August 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: SAME AS THE 28TH.

-------------------
### Day 21: August 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: SAME AS THE 29TH. Except I will grace you with a screenshot now that it's coming together. Spot the bug. Silly input tag. Accidently: `<input class="submit">` Needed: `<input class="input">` Ha!

![30aug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28552595/44888049-06877000-ac84-11e8-929c-df208b39461e.jpeg)

-------------------
### Day 22: August 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: SAME AS THE 30TH. Except I finished! Ha! Smashed the last of the bugs and researched .jar processes until I just decided on a .zip from Github. The image below is of the score leaderboard. It can display leaders based on difficulty level.

**Thoughts**: Nothing like a deadline to get you focused. I can also now look back and realize I wasted a lot of time getting caught up in Spring bugs. GeeWhiz do I wish I would've had the forsight and confidence in my abilities to NOT need to create a web apllication. 'MVP is best' is what I always say, but my definition of an MVP in this case was almost too big. I spent way too much time debugging non-hangman game related things.

-------------------
### Day 23: September 1, 2018

**Thoughts**: Now that the deadline is off my back.. can I fix that I/O error the REST API is handing me?? Done. Just takes a bit of time and patience. A deadline is not helpful for me, just means my head is frantic.

-------------------
### Day 24: September 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Took time to look over my hangman code in perparation for the interview. This also involved some inevitable refactoring, so I'm counting it as a coding day. Next time, be more clear with variable names!

-------------------
### Day 25: September 5, 2018

**Thoughts**: Two hour long technical interview about my hangman application. And hours of studying it and creating improvements the night before. I'm counting it as a coding day!

-------------------
### Day 26: September 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Week 1 of Course 2 and working on Course 3 out of 4 in the OOP in Java: Data Structures and Algorithm Specialization. _Course 2: Data Structures and Performance. Course 3: Advanced Data Structures in Java._
