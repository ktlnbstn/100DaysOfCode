# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### GOALS
I so easily get caught up in wanting to research 'what I should be learning,' that my personal projects have suffered. With this 100 Day challenge, I will dedicate a short amount of time each day to just create, no shame otherwise attached. I have two goals:
 #### 1) Bolster my personal project with a new front-end.

 #### 2) Keep hammering away at Java fundamentals and Data Structures and Algorithms.

### Day 0: July 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Two goals with lots of TODOs. Working on Week 1 of Course 1 out of 4 in the OOP in Java: Data Structures and Algorithm Specialization.

**Thoughts**: Reprioritized my goals. Reaffirming my direction.

-------------------
### Day 1: July 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Cleaning up minor PuppyLove errors and features so I can prep it for hosting asap!

**Thoughts:** Coding a project is sooo much more fun than studying algorithms.

-------------------
### Day 2: July 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working on user input error validation. Testing, testing, testing...

-------------------
### Day 3: July 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working on validating the input during the 'Edit Playdate' event. 

**Thoughts**: Coding is having the knowledge to know how to put working code together, combined with the patience to debug 
that code.

-------------------
### Day 4: July 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Validation work complete! GoogleMaps functionality added! 

**Thoughts**: Coding(debugging) gets so much easier with practice. I solved so many problems, very easily, on my own today. Felt great.

-------------------
### Day 5: July 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: PuppyLove is hosted! Register now! 

**Thoughts**: One moment I was lost in Jenkins CI, and the next I had a hosted web application that I shared with my friends and the world. Really brought home the idea that when you're lost/confused/sad from coding, just step away from your desk. Feels pretty good.

-------------------
### Day 6: July 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: PuppyLove is hosted, now working on updating. I hope I found a way to make the upstart time faster, Uptime Robot will ping the site every 8 minutes. Ideally Heroku servers keep PL alive so visitors have an easy time visiting it. I also went to a Cracking the Coding Interview Meetup to keep up my DS/A practice.

-------------------
### Day 7: July 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Back to learning now that the project is live. Made a custom Map that displayed two maps able to zoom in with your mouse. Played with PApplet, Microsoft Maps, and design modifications.

-------------------
### Day 8: July 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Last two days have been a combo a apprenticeship applications. So less focus on coding sadly. But today I sat down for an hour of DS in Java. Helpful to keep thinking about code everyday even if it's not your main focus.

-------------------
### Day 14: August 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Event-Driven programming! Half way through, implemented hover for additional info. Click to clear other markers away is upcoming. GUI work is not my favorite.
